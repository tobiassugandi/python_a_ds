The package is a supplement to [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html). It contains implementations of basic data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, trees, and graphs. Some implementation details are intentionally left out and readers are encouraged to complete them on their own.

### Object-oriented programming

- Typical class implementation
- Use of getters, setters, and properties
- Overriding _magic_ methods (len, str, contains etc)

### Basic data structures

- Stack
- Queue
- Deque
- Ordered linked list
- Unordered linked list

### Searching

- HashMap

### Sorting

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Shell sort
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort

### Trees

- Binary tree
- Binary search tree
- AVL tree
- Binary heap
- Priority queue

### Graphs

- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm
- Prim's spanning tree algorithm
